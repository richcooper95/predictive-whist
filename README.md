This is all a bit of fun really (we play a lot of whist in our family!) and is intended primarily as a learning
exercise for Django and Heroku.

I'm also figuring out best practice on the fly. There will be a lot of `TODO`s dotted around, and the order of
development doesn't always match what I would choose to do on a 'real' project.
